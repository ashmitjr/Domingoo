## My Approach

I first understood what features were required and what was not allowed in the task.  
After that, I planned the structure and flow of the project before starting the implementation.

My main focus was on:

- Proper DOM manipulation  
- Smooth element selection and movement  
- Correct layer handling and real-time updates  
- Clean UI behavior based on user actions  
- Following all the given rules of the task  

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS
- JavaScript (Pure DOM-based)

## Conclusion

This project was built specifically for the inter-batch competition within the given time limit.  
The goal was to complete all the assigned tasks correctly and deliver a fully working DOM-based solution.
